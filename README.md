### Kanye West Quote Generator
In the `Kanye folder` you can find `Kanye West Quote Generator`. This Python script `main.py` creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application using the `tkinter` library that displays random Kanye West quotes fetched from the [Kanye REST API](https://api.kanye.rest/). The application features an image of Kanye West and a canvas to display the quotes. When you click the provided button, a new random quote from Kanye West will replace the existing one on the canvas.

### Features:
- Fetches random Kanye West quotes from the API.
- Dynamically updates and displays the fetched quote on the canvas.
- Provides a visually appealing GUI with background and image.

### Usage:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required Python libraries (`requests`, `tkinter`) installed.
3. Place your custom background image as "background.png" and an image of Kanye West as "kanye.png" in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
5. Click the Kanye West image button to fetch and display a new quote.
