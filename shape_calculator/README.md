# Shape Calculator

Description:
The "Shape Calculator" is a Python program that allows users to perform basic calculations for different geometric shapes, including triangles, circles, and rectangles. This README file provides an overview of the program's functionality and how to use it.

Features:
1. **Triangle Calculations:**
   - Calculate the perimeter of a triangle.
   - Calculate the area of a triangle.
   - Identify the type of triangle (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene) based on the input side lengths.

2. **Circle Calculations:**
   - Calculate the perimeter (circumference) of a circle.
   - Calculate the area of a circle.

3. **Rectangle Calculations:**
   - Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.
   - Calculate the area of a rectangle.

Usage Instructions:
1. Run the program by executing the "main()" function.
2. You will be prompted to enter the type of shape you want to calculate (triangle, circle, or rectangle) or type "quit" to exit the program.

   - For triangles:
     - Enter the lengths of the three sides.
     - The program will calculate the type of triangle (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene), its perimeter, and area.

   - For circles:
     - Enter the radius of the circle.
     - The program will calculate the circle's perimeter (circumference) and area.

   - For rectangles:
     - Enter the length and width of the rectangle.
     - The program will calculate the rectangle's perimeter and area.

   - If an unsupported shape is entered, the program will provide an error message and allow you to try again.

3. The program is designed to run indefinitely until you choose to exit by typing "quit."

Example Output:
- The program will display the shape type, triangle type (if applicable), perimeter, and area for the selected shape.

Note:
- Ensure that you provide valid input, such as positive numbers for side lengths and radii.
- The program checks whether a valid triangle can be formed with the given sides based on the triangle inequality theorem.
